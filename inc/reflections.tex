\section{Reflections}

In this section you will need to discuss what was the most difficult aspect of the development process and reflect on what you learnt from those challenges, and from the project as a whole.

The main goal of writing this section is for you to learn by reflecting on what when well and what went badly.  This can be in the form of a Game Postmortem~\footnote{\url{https://blog.codinghorror.com/game-development-postmortems/}} where you describe 5 good things that went better than expected, and 5 bad things and how you would change them.

We are looking for your ability to reflect on the challenges you faces and learn from those challenges.  Why these situations contributed to your learning, and what will you take forward into future projects.

\subsection {The Good}

\subsubsection{Final collaboration}
The final crunch period worked very well.  This section should have enough content to show that you understand why things went well and how you will try to encourage this again.

There should be another 4 things here. If you want you can add more than 5 but not less than 5.

\subsection {The Bad}


\section{ Personal Reflections}
This section describes the individual reflections on learning.
